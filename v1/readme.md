Adapter for ESP32-Dev-C &amp; M5stack modules. It can be viewed [on Altium](https://365.altium.com/files/CDB3C9AB-1C0E-4B25-A3A4-1780F1BBCA1A) or [Easy Eda](https://easyeda.com/editor#id=49352f7d047e4be9b435180f0d233d80)

It is used as a replacement for the 'core' modules in the M5stack system. It should be compatible with any [ESP32-DevKitC V4](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005001838731651.html)

When used with [Olimex ESP32 lipo](https://www.olimex.com/Products/IoT/ESP32/ESP32-DevKit-LiPo/open-source-hardware) it can provide an completely open hardware module in the  [M5 stack system](https://shop.m5stack.com/collections/stack-series). 

Includes a [UEXT socket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEXT#Electrical_characteristics) for interfacing with [additional modules](https://www.olimex.com/Products/Modules/UEXT/) The UEXT pins can alternatively be used as breakout pins for jumper cables.

There are [other open hardware M5stack boards](https://oshwlab.com/Rosmo/m5-proto)
